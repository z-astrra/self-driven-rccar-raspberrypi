The goal of this project was to steer and speed control a rc-car autonomously by avoiding obstacle.

Parts required:
* rc-car (servos to steer & speed control)
* sonar sensor
* raspberry pi

The code reads sonar sensor data to determine obstacle infort of it. If it gets close to any obstacle it will steer itself away from it. 
In this example the car drive itself forward until it gets close any obstacle. Once it detects obstacle, it steer itself toward other direcion.
