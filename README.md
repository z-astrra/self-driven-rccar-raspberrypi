The goal of this project was to steer and speed control an rc-car autonomously by avoiding obstacle.
Parts required:
* rc-car (servos to steer & speed control)
* sonar sensor
* raspberry pi
The code reads sensor data to determine obstacle infort of it. If it gets close to any obstacle it will steer itself away from it.
